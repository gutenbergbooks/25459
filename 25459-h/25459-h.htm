<p>This little book contains, with a few additions,
the substance of what was spoken one Sabbath to a
number of hearers of your own age. It may serve to
recall to those that listened to it, and to unfold to
those who did not, some simple and well-known, but
precious gospel truths.</p>

<p>May He whose <span class="smcap2">NAME</span> it is designed to exalt, bless
you in reading it, and enable you from the heart to
repeat as your own happy experience, the well-known
verse of the beautiful hymn I have put on the title-page.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a></span></p>

<h2><a name="I" id="I"></a>I.</h2>


<p>When travelling lately through the
Simplon&mdash;one of the great Alpine passes
leading from Switzerland into Italy&mdash;I
observed, close by the roadside, at regular
distances, a number of plain, square
buildings. On these (sometimes over
the doorway, sometimes on the side)
were inscribed the words&mdash;&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Refuge</span>
No. 1,&rdquo; &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Refuge</span> No. 2,&rdquo; &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Refuge</span>
No. 3,&rdquo; &amp;c. I think there were twenty
altogether. I was told, on inquiry, they
were intended as shelters for any hapless
travellers who might be overtaken by
the sudden storms which so often sweep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">Pg 8</a></span>
down from the snow-white mountains
bounding the prospect. These &ldquo;<i>Refuges</i>,&rdquo;
at the time I saw them, were
empty, for it was in the beginning of
summer, when everything, even in that
elevated region, was looking bright and
green. The Alpine rhododendron was
flushing, with its pink blossom, the
mountain sides; or growing up, along
with the lovely blue gentian, close by
stray patches of winter's snow which
were still filling the ridges and hollows
in the higher parts of the pass. Seldom
at this season are travellers exposed
to any peril from an Alpine storm. It
is different, however, in winter or spring,
when the avalanches come tumbling from
the heights, or the snow is drifting in huge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">Pg 9</a></span>
masses over that wonderful Road. Many
shivering wayfarers have fled with thankful
hearts into these shelters. Some have
been carried thither, in a state of insensibility,
by unknown benefactors, and on
gradually awaking to consciousness, have
blessed the kind hearts and hands which
have saved them from certain death, and
are now ministering to their necessities.
By others, alas! they have been reached
too late. Rescued from the snows of the
mountain, they have been conveyed to
them only to die.</p>

<p>As I passed those Alpine &ldquo;Retreats,&rdquo;
I could not help being reminded of the
wonderful <i>Cities of Refuge</i> which God
graciously provided of old in Palestine
for the unfortunate manslayer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">Pg 10</a></span></p>

<p>It sometimes happened, in the land of
Canaan, as in our own country, that a
Hebrew, without any evil purpose, would
cause the death of a brother Hebrew.
He did not intend to inflict any injury;
it was the result only of unhappy accident.
But, nevertheless, to show God's
detestation of the shedding of blood, he
was liable, by the Levitical law, to be
killed by the Avenger, or &ldquo;Goel,&rdquo;&mdash;the
person nearest related to the murdered
man. If he wished to escape with his
life, his only chance of safety was to flee
to one of these Refuge-cities. It mattered
not what his age, or name, or station
in life was. He might be young or
old, prince or noble, priest or prophet,
he was exposed every moment to death,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">Pg 11</a></span>
unless he availed himself of the offered
shelter. There was no time for delay,
he must betake himself to instant flight.
To linger might be to perish.</p>

<p>Do you not think with pity of the unhappy
fugitive, obliged thus suddenly
to leave his home and all he most loved
on earth? If at the time he caused the
death, he was working in his vineyard,
the pruning-hook must be left to rust on
the branch. If he was ploughing with
his yoke of oxen, they must be left lowing
in the furrow. If he was busied in
his harvest-field, the sheaves must be left
unbound, and the reapers receive their
wages from another's hands. If he was
returning home fatigued at evening after
the toils of the day, and longing for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">Pg 12</a></span>
grateful repose, he dare give no &ldquo;sleep
to his eyes, nor slumber to his eye-lids.&rdquo;
His child may be lying pining
in sickness at his cottage, but it
may endanger him to return to clasp
that and his other little ones in his
embrace, and bid them a fond farewell.
He may have no time to alter
his raiment or take even his scrip or
pilgrim-staff. The Avenger of blood
may be in the adjoining street, or in
the dwelling hard by. Another hour
may be fatal;&mdash;&ldquo;Skin for skin, all that
a man hath will he give for his life.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Off he speeds in breathless haste&mdash;now
along the level road&mdash;now up the steep
ascent&mdash;with his breast heaving, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">Pg 13</a></span>
drops of perspiration standing on his
brow. Friends may meet him, but
with a wave of the hand, and shouting
&ldquo;Goel! Goel!&rdquo; he rushes on with fleet
footstep. Parched with thirst in the
hot noonday, he turns a longing eye
on the ripe grapes that are hanging
in purple clusters on the wayside, or on
the water trickling down the narrow
ravine. But he dare not pause. Knowing
full well that the Avenger is in
close pursuit, he hurries on with unabated
ardor. Happy sight, when he
sees at last, on some mountain slope,
the longed-for shelter! Happy, when,
weary and footsore, covered with dust,
the portals of the city close him in.
A few moments before, had he been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">Pg 14</a></span>
overtaken on the mountain-top by his
pursuer, he might have been heard to cry
out, in the bitterness of despair, &ldquo;Hast
thou found me, O mine enemy?&rdquo; Now,
safe within the secure shelter, he can rejoicingly
exclaim, even with the Avenger
standing close by, &ldquo;O thou enemy, destructions
are come to a perpetual end.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>These <i>Cities of Refuge</i> form one of
the Old Testament <span class="smcap2">PICTURES</span> of the sinner,
and of the coming gospel salvation.
This was the way God took to teach the
Jewish people great gospel truths. Just
as we know that youthful readers like
a story-book all the better when it has
got pictures in it; so God taught the
early church, when it was in a state of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">Pg 15</a></span>
&ldquo;<i>childhood</i>,&rdquo; by means of similar <i>pictures</i>
or <i>types</i>; and the present was one of them.
It represented, and still represents, the
sinner who has broken the Divine law
as pursued by an avenger: <span class="smcap">Justice</span> following
with drawn sword, exclaiming,
&ldquo;<i>The soul that sinneth it must die.</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
&ldquo;<i>Though hand join in hand, the wicked
shall not escape unpunished.</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>This is a picture, too, which applies
to every one without exception, rich
and poor, parent and child, master and
servant; &ldquo;for all have sinned, and come
short of the glory of God.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> But a
glorious <span class="smcap2">CITY</span>, &ldquo;<i>salvation</i> its walls and
bulwarks,&rdquo; opens its gates. The sinner
is exhorted to &ldquo;escape thither;&rdquo; to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">Pg 16</a></span>
&ldquo;linger not in all the plain;&rdquo; to &ldquo;flee
for his life, lest he be consumed.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
That city is <i>Jesus</i>, the sinner's Refuge
and the sinner's Friend. Once within
its walls, no enemy can touch him,&mdash;no
sword can terrify him. He can
triumphantly exclaim, &ldquo;Who shall separate
me from the love of Christ?&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Dear young friends, it is because I
know this City of Refuge is open for
the youngest of <i>you</i>, that I now write
these pages. I love to read about a
group of little ones who, eighteen hundred
years ago, were gathered round
its gates, asking admission; and when
others, with unkind words, were sending
them away, He who held the gates<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">Pg 17</a></span>
in His hand, &ldquo;<i>who openeth and no man
shutteth</i>,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> said, &ldquo;<i>Suffer the little children
to come unto me, and forbid them
not; for of such is the kingdom of
heaven.</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> It is because I believe and
know that many as young as <i>you</i> have
obeyed the Saviour's invitation, and
have already entered this happy City,
that I ask you to come and hear while
I speak to you about it. I believe and
know that many such have learned to
feel that they are sinners, and that they
need a Saviour. They have been taught
by God's own Word and Spirit that they
have broken His holy law, and have
thereby exposed themselves to eternal
death. But they are now safe within<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">Pg 18</a></span>
the Gospel Shelter. The &ldquo;enemy&rdquo; is
&ldquo;stilled.&rdquo; The &ldquo;avenger&rdquo; has sheathed
his sword. I think I can hear their
youthful voices, as they march through
the streets of the City, singing, &ldquo;<i>Out
of the mouth of babes and sucklings
hast thou ordained strength because
of thine enemies, that thou mightest</i>
<span class="smcap2">STILL</span> <i>the enemy and the</i> <span class="smcap2">AVENGER</span>.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
&ldquo;<i>Blessed be the Lord; for He hath
showed me His marvellous kindness in</i>
<span class="smcap2">A STRONG CITY</span>.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>It is of these <i>six cities</i> here mentioned,
I am now going to speak. The name

to tell about <span class="smcap2">THE NAME OF JESUS</span>.
They are six pictures of the Saviour,
hung up in the Old Testament picture-gallery.
I am going to ask you to take
a journey with me to these towns of old
Palestine. Before we enter their gates,
I should like again to repeat the verse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">Pg 22</a></span>
of the precious hymn placed at the
beginning of this book:&mdash;</p>

<h3>First City&mdash;Kedesh.</h3>

<p>If you look far north in the map of
Palestine above the lake of Merom, near
the snowy peaks of mount Hermon and
Lebanon, you will see where this Refuge-city
lies. Recent travellers describe its
ruins as still standing on a rocky ridge
in the midst of green hills, surrounded
with the remains of forts and castles
built by the Crusaders in the middle
ages. It was situated within the tribe
of Naphtali, and must have been it great
town at the time when the old warrior
Barak, who was born within its walls,
marched from its gates to meet Sisera in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">Pg 24</a></span>
the plain below with his nine hundred
chariots of iron.</p>

<p>What does its name tell of Christ?</p>

<p>The Hebrew word <span class="smcap">Kedesh</span> signifies
&ldquo;<i>Holy</i>.&rdquo; Jesus was &ldquo;<i>The Holy One</i>.&rdquo;
Not one stain of sin polluted His holy
human nature. Angels in heaven, as
they cast their crowns at His feet, cry,
&ldquo;<i>Holy! holy! holy!</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Devils on
earth were compelled to exclaim, &ldquo;<i>We
know thee who thou art, the</i> <span class="smcap">Holy One</span>
<i>of God.</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Jewish priests, as they
spake of Him of old by types, took &ldquo;<i>a
lamb without blemish</i>.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Jewish prophets,
as they spake of Him in their
predictions, called Him &ldquo;<i>The Righteous</i>
(<i>or</i> <span class="smcap">Holy</span>) <i>Branch</i>.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Apostles, as they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">Pg 25</a></span>
wrote about Him, said &ldquo;<i>He was</i> <span class="smcap2">HOLY</span>,
<i>harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners.</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
When He was Himself on earth,
He could challenge His bitterest foes,
&ldquo;<i>Which of you convinceth me of sin?</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
And when He came down, soon after
His ascension, from His throne in the
skies, we find Him proclaiming as His
name, &ldquo;<i>He that is</i> <span class="smcap2">HOLY</span>, <i>He that is
True!</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Reader, remember this. Jesus never
could have saved you unless He had
been &ldquo;glorious in holiness.&rdquo; If He had
had one sin in Him, you and I must have
been lost for ever. Just as one leak in
Noah's ark of old would have sunk it,
so one leak of sin in Jesus, the true Ark,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">Pg 26</a></span>
would have plunged us all in the depths
of eternal despair. Let us, then, love
often to walk round the walls of <span class="smcap">Kedesh</span>,
and think of <i>our</i> &ldquo;City of Refuge&rdquo; as
&ldquo;<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Holy</span> <i>Child Jesus</i>.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>And when you ponder <i>His</i> holiness,
seek to be holy, as <i>He</i> was. How He
hated sin! How He loved to do His
heavenly Father's will! How gentle,
and good, and kind He was to all! He
never was angry, or passionate, or revengeful.
When a youth, at His early
home in Nazareth, &ldquo;He increased in
favour with God and man.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Be <i>like</i>
Jesus in His <i>holiness</i>! Let <i>KEDESH</i>
be a word written on your young hearts!
Whenever you are in trouble or difficulty,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">Pg 27</a></span>
or temptation, always ask, &ldquo;How
would the <span class="smcap">Holy Jesus</span> have acted here?&rdquo;
Turn the words of your well-known
hymn into a prayer. While you say&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;I love the <span class="smcap2">NAME</span> of Jesus,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Immanuel, Christ the Lord;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like fragrance on the breezes,<br /></span>

<h3>Second City&mdash;Shechem.</h3>

<p>Shechem was situated at the extremity
of a valley among the hills of Ephraim.
The famous mountains of Ebal and Gerizim
rose on either side, from the slopes
of which the blessings and the curses
of the law were proclaimed in the ears
of assembled Israel. If Jerusalem was
the greatest and the grandest of the
cities of Palestine, Shechem was perhaps
the most beautiful. It is still spoken of
by travellers as one of the loveliest spots
in the Holy Land, with its orchards of
olive, fig, and pomegranate, and its flocks
of singing-birds, which have made the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">Pg 30</a></span>
inhabitants give to the graceful slope on
which it looks down, the name of the
&ldquo;Musical Valley.&rdquo; I don't know if the
streets in the olden time resembled what
they are now. The following is the
recent description of a traveller familiar
with them:&mdash;&ldquo;The streets are narrow
and vaulted over, and in the winter time
it is difficult to pass along many of them
on account of brooks, which rush over
the pavement with deafening roar....
It has mulberry, orange, pomegranate,
and other trees mingled in with the
houses, whose odoriferous flowers load
the air with delicious perfume during
the months of April and May.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> You
do not require to be told that <i>Shechem</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">Pg 31</a></span>
is a very ancient city, and that many
interesting events in sacred story took
place in connexion with it. The earliest
mention made of it is when the patriarch
Abraham slept under its oaks, (the
Terebinths of Moreh,) when he came to
Canaan from distant Chaldea, and erected
his first altar under their shade;<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and
one of the last Bible notices regarding
it, is in connexion with the woman of
Samaria, when Jesus sat with her at &ldquo;the
well of Sychar,&rdquo; and spoke to her of the
better fountain, &ldquo;springing up to everlasting
life.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>What does the name <span class="smcap">Shechem</span> tell of
Christ?</p>

<p>It is a word which means &ldquo;<span class="smcap2">SHOULDER</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">Pg 32</a></span>Jesus, our Refuge, bore a guilty world
upon His shoulder. The ancients had a
fabled Atlas, who was supposed to carry
the earth on his shoulders. Jesus Christ
is the true <span class="smcap">Atlas</span>. &ldquo;<i>Surely He hath
borne our griefs and carried our sorrows!</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
All the sins of all His people
Jesus bore for ever away. Think of
that heavy load which bowed Him down
to the ground in the garden of Gethsemane,
and caused drops of blood to
fall from His brow! No other one <i>but</i>
Jesus could have carried such an awful
load and burden as this. No angel or
archangel could have done so. Jesus,
being God, was alone &ldquo;able to save unto
the uttermost.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> He is the only &ldquo;sure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">Pg 33</a></span>
foundation&rdquo; that could sustain all the
building.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> With any other, it would
have fallen into a mass of ruins.</p>

<p>But I love not only to visit the old
city of <i>Shechem</i>, and to think of Jesus
bearing the guilt of His people on His
<i>shoulders</i>, but I like to think of Him
as the true <span class="smcap">Shechem</span> <i>now</i>. He is our
<i>Shechem</i> at God's right hand. &ldquo;The
government is upon His <span class="smcap2">SHOULDER</span>.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
The Church and the world are upheld
by Him. Believers&mdash;the poorest, the
weakest, the humblest&mdash;are on the
<i>shoulders</i> of Jesus. He is bearing the
weight of them all; loving them all,
attending to them all, interceding for
them all. All that befalls me, Jesus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">Pg 34</a></span>
orders. Food and raiment, health and
strength, friends and home, are gifts
from Him. Every tear I shed, He
knows it, He appoints it. If he sends
me sorrow and trial, I will go and enter
the gates of this city <span class="smcap">Shechem</span>, and
remember, &ldquo;<i>Jesus</i> (Jesus, who died for
me) bears me on his <i>shoulder</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moses speaks of God conducting the
children of Israel through the wilderness
of old as a kind father carries on
his shoulder his weak and weary child.
&ldquo;<i>Thou hast seen how that the Lord thy
God bare thee, as a man doth bear his
son.</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> And David says in an hour of
trouble, &ldquo;<i>I am poor and needy, yet the
Lord</i> (lit) <i>carries</i> me on his heart.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">Pg 35</a></span>I like to look at that New Testament
picture&mdash;Jesus, the good Shepherd, carrying
a bleating sheep or lamb back
on His shoulder to the fold. That poor
wanderer had gone astray on the dark
mountains; but the great and gracious
Shepherd had gone after it &ldquo;until He
found it; and when He <i>had</i> found it,
<i>He laid it on His SHOULDERS,
rejoicing</i>.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>Young reader, what <i>perfect</i> security
and safety you have in Jesus, and in His
Gospel City! Far, far more so than the
manslayer had of old in his. I daresay,
even although he was delivered from
the Avenger, the Hebrew refugee could
not help at times dreading lest the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">Pg 36</a></span>
might come upon him secretly. I daresay,
at night, on his lonely couch, he
would sometimes dream of the Goel
stealing beside his pillow, and he would
start from his unquiet sleep at the scaring
vision. Not so in the case of those
who have fled to the &ldquo;Gospel Refuge.&rdquo;
They can say in sweet confidence, &ldquo;I
will both lay me down in peace, and
sleep; because thou, Lord, only makest
me to dwell in safety.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> He who is
their &ldquo;<i>Keeper</i>&rdquo; says of them, &ldquo;<i>They
shall never perish; neither shall any
pluck them out of my hand.</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<h3>Third City&mdash;Hebron.</h3>

<p>Hebron is the most ancient of all the
cities of Canaan. It was as old, if not
older, than Damascus, and was built
seven years before Zoar in Egypt. After
wandering about from place to place in
the land of promise, pitching their tents
and altars, it was here the patriarchs
had, for the first time, a settled home.
We need not wonder at their selection
of the old Canaanite city, on the peaceful
slope of the southern hills, nestling
amid olive-groves and terebinths, and
looking down on one of the most fertile<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">Pg 38</a></span>
valleys in Palestine, with its orchards
and corn-fields. On its eastern height
is the spot which gives it to this day
perhaps its most sacred interest&mdash;the
cave of Machpelah, where the dust of
the patriarchs has reposed for four thousand
years. It must have been outside
its walls that the angels appeared to
Abraham, when he was seated at his tent
door. The adjoining height is pointed
out as the place from which the patriarch
saw the smoke of burning Sodom
rising from its own deep valley. It was
in Hebron David was anointed king over
Israel. It was amid its vineyards and
mountain-slopes that John the Baptist
grew up as a little boy, before he appeared
in the wilderness of Judea, to tell of One<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">Pg 39</a></span>
mightier than he, &ldquo;whose shoe-latchet&rdquo;
he was &ldquo;not worthy to unloose.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>What does the name <span class="smcap">Hebron</span> tell of
Christ?</p>

<p>In Hebrew it means &ldquo;<i>fellowship</i>,&rdquo;
&ldquo;<i>society</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>friendship</i>.&rdquo; <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> has
brought guilty man into fellowship with
God. On account of sin we had forfeited
this fellowship. We had made
God not our friend, but our enemy.
We were cut off from communion with
all that is holy and happy. Angels, in
their errands of mercy through the universe,
passed by our world; they could
hold no intercourse with those who had
rebelled against their Creator. Can none
bridge this wide gulf which separates<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">Pg 40</a></span>
between earth and heaven? Can no ladder
be let down by which happy angels
can descend once more on their visits of
love, and fallen man once more be raised
up to hold &ldquo;fellowship&rdquo; with God and
holy creatures?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jesus</span> is the true <span class="smcap">Hebron</span>&mdash;the true
ladder of Jacob let down from heaven
and reaching to earth. Jesus has &ldquo;reconciled
things on earth and things in
heaven,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> He hath &ldquo;raised us up together,
and made us sit together in heavenly
places.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> We who were once
&ldquo;afar off&rdquo; have been &ldquo;brought nigh
by the blood of Christ.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>I trust many who read this will love
often to visit in thought the old city of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">Pg 41</a></span>
the patriarchs, and to dwell on its name
and meaning, &ldquo;<i>fellowship</i>.&rdquo; Think of
what <i>you</i> would have been without Jesus,
your Hebron-City of Refuge,&mdash;a poor
outcast in creation, an alien from all that
is holy and happy. But by Jesus all is
changed. God is your Father&mdash;Christ
is your elder Brother. In Him, God
loves you,&mdash;angels visit you,&mdash;the Holy
Spirit teaches you,&mdash;heaven is open for
you. You are enrolled as a citizen of
the great <i>Hebron</i> above&mdash;&ldquo;the city which
hath foundations, whose builder and
maker is God.&rdquo; Christ has made you to
be members of the great heavenly family;
so that the little child who loves
Jesus, is brother or sister to the archangel
before the throne! You may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">Pg 42</a></span>
deprived of human friendship and fellowship.
The brother or sister, the father
or mother, or friend you once dearly
loved, may be laid in some earthly Machpelah&mdash;some
silent grave. But rejoice!
nothing can separate you from a better
friend and more lasting fellowship.
Though all earthly joys were to perish,
you can always rush within the gates of
that mighty Hebron of refuge, and say,
&ldquo;<i>Truly our</i> '<span class="smcap2">FELLOWSHIP</span>' <i>is with the Father,
and with his Son Jesus Christ.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Fourth City&mdash;Bezer.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Bezer</span> was situated beyond the Jordan,
in the tribe of Reuben. Although its
precise site has not been discovered, we
may infer that it was perched on one of
the many rocky heights among the mountains
of <i>Abarim</i>,&mdash;perhaps a spur of the
great mount Nebo, from whose summit
Moses was permitted, before death, to
get a view of the Land of Promise.
The northern portion of the waters of
the Dead Sea would be seen from it, and
the pastoral mountains of Judah in the
distance. From its name, as well as
from its being a border town, and subject
to attack from the warlike tribe of Moab,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">Pg 44</a></span>
Bezer would probably be strongly fortified,&mdash;similar,
perhaps, in this respect to
the towns in the neighbourhood, with
which the Israelites were so struck on
their first approach to Canaan, with &ldquo;their
walls great and high, reaching to heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What does the name <span class="smcap">Bezer</span> tell of
Christ?</p>

<p>It literally means &ldquo;<i>stronghold</i>,&rdquo; or
Rock. Jesus is the believer's <span class="smcap">Bezer</span>.
The sinner is in danger everywhere else,
but in Jesus he is safe. He is invited to
&ldquo;turn to the <span class="smcap2">STRONGHOLD</span>&rdquo; as a &ldquo;prisoner
of hope,&rdquo; and once within its gates,
&ldquo;though an host encamp against him,&rdquo;
he need &ldquo;fear no evil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What a mighty force <i>does</i> encamp
against him! There is <i>God's Holy Law</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">Pg 45</a></span>
with all its terrible threatenings and
curses. But sheltered in the true <span class="smcap">Bezer</span>
he can triumphantly say, &ldquo;It is God that
justifieth: who is he that condemneth?&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>There is <i>Satan</i>, with his artful wiles
and countless temptations. He was once
a bright angel himself. He knows what
holiness and happiness are. But being
now a wicked spirit, he would make
others as wicked and unhappy as himself.
He is spoken of in the Bible as &ldquo;a strong
man armed.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> But Jesus is &ldquo;stronger&rdquo;
than this strong man. If you have fled
for refuge to this great gospel <i>Bezer</i>,
seated within its secure bulwarks you
can joyfully exclaim, &ldquo;<i>I will say of the
Lord, He is my rock, and my fortress,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">Pg 46</a></span> and my deliverer; my God, my strength,
in whose I will put my trust; my buckler,
and the horn of my salvation, and my
high tower.</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>There is your own <i>Wicked Heart</i>, with
its sinful thoughts, and vain imaginations,
and deep corruptions&mdash;for a man's
worst foes are often those of his own
household. One of these heart-foes will
tempt you to tell a lie; another to swear;
another to be dishonest; another to be
selfish; another to be passionate; another
to be unkind. But He that is <i>for</i> you,
is greater than they that are <i>against</i> you.
Safer than in any earthly castle, you can
take up your warrior-song, &ldquo;<i>The name
of the Lord is a strong tower: the righteous
runneth into it, and is safe.</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">Pg 47</a></span>There are the <i>Trials and Sorrows and
Distresses of this world</i>,&mdash;those things
that cause sad hearts and tearful eyes.
But that blessed Saviour&mdash;your Rock and
Stronghold&mdash;&ldquo;knows your sorrows,&rdquo; for
He felt them. He marks your tears, for
He shed the same himself. Fleeing to
this true <span class="smcap">Bezer</span> in the time of affliction,
you can dry your tears and sing, &ldquo;<i>God
also will be a refuge for the distressed, a
refuge in the time of trouble; and they
that know thy name shall put their trust
in thee.</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>And there is <i>Death</i>, the last enemy of
all. But even over this King of terrors
and Terror of kings, you can shout in
triumph from your Divine shelter, &ldquo;<i>O
death, where is thy sting?... Thanks</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">Pg 48</a></span><i> be to God, who giveth me the victory
through the Lord Jesus Christ.</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>And Jesus is a Stronghold for <i>all</i>. I
have already spoken of the little children
of old rushing to its gates,&mdash;infants smiling
fearless in the Saviour's arms. He
combines the majesty of Deity with the
tenderness of man. If He had been the
great God alone, you might have been
awed at the thought of going to Him.
But what says the prophet Isaiah of this
true <span class="smcap">Bezer</span>?&mdash;&ldquo;<i>A MAN shall be as a
hiding-place from the wind, and a covert
from the tempest.</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> He Himself says in
another scripture, &ldquo;<i>I will turn mine
hand upon the little ones.</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>In one of the great strongholds that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">Pg 49</a></span>
were besieged in our last Indian rebellion,
the Christian mothers were wont to
hush their infants asleep by singing, &ldquo;<i>God
is our refuge and strength, a very present
help in trouble.</i>&rdquo; My young friends, &ldquo;<i>as
one whom his mother comforteth</i>,&rdquo; so is
God willing to &ldquo;<i>comfort you</i>;&rdquo; and here
is His word of comfort: &ldquo;<i>The Lord is
good, a STRONGHOLD in the day of
trouble; and he knoweth them that trust
in him.</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> In the old Cities of Refuge
no weapons of any kind were allowed to
be made. Those who possessed them
had to surrender them. This is true in a
nobler and better sense regarding the
Gospel Stronghold. There can be no
deadly weapons forged there. Their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">Pg 50</a></span>
edge is blunted: &ldquo;<i>There is now no condemnation
to them that are in Christ
Jesus.</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Satan's armoury has been
plundered; the &ldquo;Stronger than he&rdquo; has
&ldquo;<i>taken from him all his armour wherein
he trusted, and divided the spoil</i>.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>I have said that the word <span class="smcap">Bezer</span> means
&ldquo;<i>Rock</i>&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;stronghold.&rdquo;
&ldquo;<i>Trust in the Lord for ever; for in the
Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength</i>,&rdquo;
or, (marginal reading,) &ldquo;<span class="smcap">the Rock of
Ages</span>.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> May you not well say, with

<h3>Fifth City&mdash;Ramoth.</h3>

<p>Ramoth was situated in Gilead, within
the tribe of Gad, and somewhere near
the banks of the brook Jabbok, where,
you know, Jacob wrestled in prayer
with the angel. It must have occupied a
commanding position among the beautifully-wooded
glens of Gilead, and, like
Bezer, been strongly fortified. We infer
this latter from the many sieges it had
undergone. Being not only, like the
other, a border town of Palestine, but
situated in the direct route taken by the
invading Syrian armies, it must have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">Pg 52</a></span>
been constantly exposed to hostile attacks.</p>

<p>You can think of Ramoth, then, among
the hills and slopes on the other side of
the Jordan, with their forests of native
oak, which the famous &ldquo;<i>bulls</i> of Bashan&rdquo;
(herds of wild cattle) roamed at large;
while more peaceful flocks browsed on
the meadows which fringed the mountain-streams.</p>

<p>What does the name <span class="smcap">Ramoth</span> tell us
regarding Christ?</p>

<p><i>Ramoth</i> literally means <span class="smcap">Exaltation</span>.
Jesus is the true <i>Ramoth</i>; He is &ldquo;<i>exalted</i>
to be a Prince and a Saviour!&rdquo; He
was once lowly, despised, rejected, crucified,
slain. He compares Himself to a
poor outcast and exile amid these forests<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">Pg 53</a></span>
of Gilead: &ldquo;<i>Many bulls have compassed
me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me
round. They gaped upon me with their
mouths, as a ravening and a roaring
lion.</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> But having been exalted on the
cross as a <i>suffering</i> Saviour, He is now
exalted on the throne as a <i>glorious</i> King.
&ldquo;<i>God hath highly</i> <span class="smcap2">EXALTED</span> <i>Him</i>;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>&mdash;angels
exalt Him&mdash;seraphs adore Him&mdash;saints
praise Him&mdash;the Church on earth
magnifies Him&mdash;the Church redeemed in
heaven will magnify and exalt Him for
ever and ever!</p>

<p>Young reader, delight often to walk
around the walls of <i>Ramoth</i>, and think
of Jesus &ldquo;exalted at God's right hand.&rdquo;
He is there pleading your cause. Though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">Pg 54</a></span>
exalted, He has not forgotten the lowliest
or humblest of His people. He is
the Greatest of all Beings, but He is the
Kindest of all too. The first time after
His exaltation when He came down to
earth to speak to the aged apostle John,
John wondered if the glories of heaven
had altered His love and tenderness. He
remembered how often before he used to
lean on His bosom. When he looked,
however, <i>now</i>, upon the glorious Being
that stood before him in His lustrous
garment, with &ldquo;His eyes like a flame of
fire,&rdquo; &ldquo;he fell down at His feet like one
dead.&rdquo; But the same gentle hand
touched him, the same gentle voice he
was wont to hear so often in past years,
said to him, &ldquo;Fear not!&rdquo; How sweet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">Pg 55</a></span>
for us to think that we have <i>exalted</i> on
the highest throne of the universe an unchanged
and unchanging Saviour, an
ever-living, never-dying Friend.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Though now ascended up on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He bends on earth a brother's eye.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jesus</span> is exalted in heaven, and exalted
by all the glorious family of heaven.
But, alas! there is one place where
He is often <i>not</i> exalted, but rather cast
down, and that is the human heart.
That heart has been too truly compared
to the inn of Bethlehem, where
there was room for every guest but
the Lord of glory! Ye of tender
years, whom Christ loved so much
on earth&mdash;whom He fondled in His
arms of mercy; see that it is not
so with you. &ldquo;My son,&rdquo; He says,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">Pg 56</a></span>
&ldquo;give me thine heart.&rdquo; See that He
is enthroned there as Lord of all. Exalt
Him in everything: in your thoughts,
in your words, in your deeds. Welcome
Him, as the children of the temple welcomed
Him to Jerusalem of old. Take up
their song, and sing, &ldquo;<i>Hosannah to the
Son of David! hosannah in the highest!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Sixth City&mdash;Golan.</h3>

<p>Golan was situated in Bashan, in the
tribe of Manasseh, among the pastoral
hills north of the lake of Gennesaret.
It formed the most northerly Refuge-Sanctuary
on the east side of Jordan,
as Kedesh did on the west; but there
are no particular events connected with
it in Bible story.</p>

<p>What does the name of this last City
of Refuge tell us regarding <i>Jesus</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Golan</span> literally signifies <i>Joy</i>. Jesus
is truly the <i>Golan</i> of His people; they
may have many others, but He is their
&ldquo;chief joy!&rdquo; Well may they call Him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">Pg 58</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Golan</span>; for not one joy could have
ever visited them had it not been for
<i>Him</i>. The world would have been to
them, from first to last, a &ldquo;valley of
Baca,&rdquo; (weeping,) had not Jesus died for
their sins, and saved their souls. Well
might the angel say, when he came to
the plains of Bethlehem to announce
the Saviour's birth, &ldquo;<i>Behold, I bring
you good tidings of</i> <span class="smcap2">GREAT JOY</span>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is not one step the Christian
takes but Jesus is <span class="smcap">Golan</span> to him&mdash;&ldquo;joy.&rdquo;
He is straying, a lost sheep on
the dark mountains, in search of peace:
Jesus meets him, and says, &ldquo;<i>Your sins
are all forgiven you</i>;&rdquo;&mdash;he is joyful at
<i>that</i>. He is wandering a prodigal
from his Father's house: Jesus brings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">Pg 59</a></span>
him to his lost home, and calls him
His own child; and he is joyful at
<i>that</i>. He has to travel a long and
dreary journey ere he reaches his true
home in heaven: Jesus gives him His
arm to lean upon; and he &ldquo;goes on his
way <i>rejoicing</i>.&rdquo; He has many fiery trials
to try him: Jesus tells him not to think
these &ldquo;strange,&rdquo; but rather to &ldquo;<i>rejoice</i>,&rdquo;
inasmuch as He is &ldquo;partaker with him
in his sufferings.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> He has, at last,
to walk through the dark Valley: Jesus
meets him there, and supports him there.
He sees &ldquo;the King in His beauty,&rdquo; and
the land that is yet &ldquo;afar off;&rdquo; and,
believing, &ldquo;<i>he rejoices with joy unspeakable
and full of glory</i>.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> When<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">Pg 60</a></span>
Jesus beholds him from His throne in
judgment, what are to be His blessed
words of welcome? &ldquo;<i>Enter ye into
the</i> <span class="smcap2">JOY</span> <i>of your Lord.</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> And when,
as a ransomed one, he enters the streets
of the New Jerusalem, at whose feet is
it that he is to cast, through all eternity,
his crown? &ldquo;In thy presence,&rdquo;
O Saviour God, is &ldquo;fullness of <span class="smcap2">JOY</span>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Young reader, love often to gaze on
the walls of this City of Refuge. The
sacred writer, in giving the list of these
six cities, seems to have kept it to the
last because it is a happy word, and
speaks of the happy prospects of all
those that love the Lord Jesus. Believe
me, there is no true <i>joy</i> but in God.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">Pg 61</a></span>
The joy of the wicked is like that of a
noisy stream&mdash;noisy because it is shallow.
The joy, on the other hand, which
Jesus gives, is like a great river,&mdash;deep,
calm, ever-flowing, overflowing;&mdash;not
full in winter and dry in summer, but
full, and clear, and refreshing all the
year long. It may be always truly said
of Jesus, the great Gospel Refuge, and
of those who have fled to Him, what was
said of old about Samaria, &ldquo;There was
great <span class="smcap2">JOY</span> in that <span class="smcap2">CITY</span>.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> It was the
object of all that Christ did and said
on earth to give you this joy. &ldquo;<i>These
things have I spoken unto you</i>,&rdquo; says
He, &ldquo;<i>that my</i> <span class="smcap2">JOY</span> <i>might remain in
you, and that your</i> <span class="smcap2">JOY</span> <i>might be full.</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">Pg 62</a></span>Love Him now, and serve Him now
and follow Him now, that you may
come at last to the true Golan, in His
glorious presence above, and &ldquo;<span class="smcap2">REJOICE</span>
<i>evermore</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>What a complete Saviour! In Him
&ldquo;all fullness dwells.&rdquo; In the case of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">Pg 66</a></span>
some of these Hebrew cities, &ldquo;not one
stone has been left upon another that
has not been thrown down.&rdquo; Owls are
screaming amid their ruins, and jackals
prowling for their prey. But not so with
<span class="smcap">Him</span> of whom they were types. <i>Jesus</i>
ever lives! He never changes. Time
and decay cannot crumble the walls of
the Gospel Refuge. He is &ldquo;the same
yesterday, and to-day, and for ever.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>I want, in this last chapter, to say one
or two additional things to you about the
Cities of Refuge. Let me ask you to
give me your earnest attention.</p>

<p>The <i>first</i> thing I wish you to remember
is, <i>that all the preciousness of that</i>
<span class="smcap2">NAME</span> <i>of Jesus, and all the security
of the</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">Pg 67</a></span><i> Gospel</i> <span class="smcap">Refuge</span>, <i>is derived
from the merits of His death for you upon the cross.</i></p>

<p>This is the truth of all truths, and one,
too, strikingly taught in these olden
types. If you read the Bible account,
you will find that the manslayer had his
liberty restored to him <i>upon the death of
the High Priest</i>.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> When the tidings of
the decease of this great Head of the
Jewish nation reached these refuge towns,
I daresay many of their citizens would be
heard, with wailing cry, mourning the
loss of God's faithful servant. But the
intelligence was very different to the
captive Hebrew. It brought him joyful
news! For that event enabled him to
go forth from his banishment, and to terminate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">Pg 68</a></span>
years of painful separation from
all he loved on earth. The avenger
could no longer injure him. He could
return, happy and secure, to the comforts
of his long-lost home.</p>

<p>So, dear reader, it is the <i>death</i> of <i>your</i>
great High Priest that has purchased
your release from spiritual captivity.
The law can no longer hold you. Justice
can no longer threaten you. You can
go forth with the glorious liberty of a
child of God, saying, &ldquo;<i>Who</i> is he that
condemneth?&mdash;<i>It is Christ that died.</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>You can picture to yourselves, on the
death of the Jewish High Priest, the
Hebrew captive going forth from the
city, within whose gloomy walls he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">Pg 69</a></span>
long been enclosed. You can picture
him, with merry heart, making the valleys
through which he hurried to his
native dwelling, echo with songs of joy!
And shall not <i>you</i>, with happier heart
and voice, sing this song as you journey
on to your heavenly home, and see it
gleaming in the distance, on the other
side of Jordan&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;When from the dust of death I rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To take my mansion in the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This all my hope&mdash;this all my plea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That <i>Jesus lived and died for me!</i>&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The <i>second</i> thing I want to say to you
is, that <i>God has made the gospel City of
Refuge easy of access, and has filled it
with rich provision</i>.</p>

<p>He made the way as plain as possible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">Pg 70</a></span>
to the manslayer of old. The cities
themselves were generally on a height,
so as to be seen at a far distance. The
roads leading to them were carefully
kept. They were broader than others
in Palestine, (sixteen yards wide.) The
Jewish magistrates and judges went
once every year to inspect them, and to
order repairs. Where streams occurred,
there were bridges thrown across.
Where there were angles or by-roads,
posts with &ldquo;<i>Refuge</i>&rdquo; on them were set
up; and as there were no bridges across
Jordan, three of the cities were placed,
as I have already mentioned, on one side
of the river, and three on the other;
so that all might easily get at them,
and none might have any excuse for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">Pg 71</a></span>
not fleeing. The nearest city could always
be reached by the manslayer in
half a day. Moreover, we are informed
there were ample stores of provisions
laid up in them. They were supplied
with wells of water, and Levites were
placed in turn as porters or gatekeepers,
to be ready to welcome every fugitive
into these homes of safety.</p>

<p>So God has done everything for <i>you</i>,
to make the Gospel Refuge accessible.
Your parents and ministers&mdash;your Bibles
and churches and good books&mdash;are all,
just like these refuge signals, pointing
away from the cross-roads and by-roads
of human reason, and human error, and
self-righteousness, to the Lord Jesus
Christ, and saying, &ldquo;Flee! flee! flee for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">Pg 72</a></span>
refuge to lay <i>hold</i> on the hope set before
you!&rdquo; <i>Jesus</i>, too, the true Gospel
Refuge, is full of rich provision. &ldquo;Ye
are complete in Him.&rdquo; He, as the true
Joseph, gives forth out of the storehouses
in His &ldquo;treasure-cities,&rdquo; to all His needy
people. What are some of these provisions?
There is pardon &mdash; peace &mdash; justification &mdash; adoption &mdash; sanctification, &mdash; strength
for the hour of weakness, &mdash; grace
for the hour of temptation, &mdash; and
the good hope of everlasting life for the
hour of death. No wonder that he says
to every poor sinner seeking admission
within these gates, &ldquo;<i>I am the bread of
life: he that cometh unto me shall never
hunger.</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">Pg 73</a></span>As in the cities of Canaan, so in this
glorious Gospel-City of which they were
types, there is a Well of living water.
What is this? It is the Holy Spirit.
He is often in Scripture compared to
water. &ldquo;<i>If any man thirst</i>,&rdquo; said Jesus,
&ldquo;<i>let him come unto me, and drink. This
spake he of the Spirit.</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> This all-glorious
well-spring, moreover, is not
like those of the Palestine cities, which
were sometimes dried up in seasons of
drought, but &ldquo;springing up unto everlasting
life.&rdquo; Angels, too, are the porters,&mdash;the
blessed warders that keep the
gates of this Gospel-City. &ldquo;<i>Are they not
all ministering spirits sent forth to minister
to them who are heirs of salvation?</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">Pg 74</a></span>
They love to watch by these gates, and
to welcome every wanderer. How
gladly they give the word, &ldquo;<i>Open ye the
gates, that the righteous</i> (those made
righteous through the righteousness of
Jesus) <i>may enter in!</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>It is delightful, moreover, to think,
that just as the Jewish cities were easily
got at from all parts of Palestine, so from
all parts of the world, may people go to
the Greater and more Glorious Gospel
Refuge. Poor Pagan of the far East!
cast away your idols; the gates of the
Gospel-City stand ready to welcome <i>you</i>.
Indian of the far West! cast aside your
warrior spear and your offerings of blood,
and flee to the portals of mercy and to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">Pg 75</a></span>
the blood which cleanseth from all sin.
Laplander of the far North, amid your
polar snows! Negro of Africa, amid
your burning sands! rush to the provided
shelter. There is salvation there
for <i>you</i>. &ldquo;The same Lord is rich to
<span class="smcap2">ALL</span> that call upon Him.&rdquo; Happy prospect!&mdash;the
time will come when the
whole world will be found singing together
the same song and uttering the
same prayer, &ldquo;<i>Open unto us the gates of
righteousness, that we may enter into them,
and praise the Lord!</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>Will none of my young friends rejoice
if they are able, by aiding the cause of
missions abroad, to help putting this
&ldquo;new song&rdquo; into the lips of those who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">Pg 76</a></span>are still &ldquo;wandering in the wilderness in
a solitary way, and have <span class="smcap2">NO CITY</span> to
dwell in?&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<br />

<p>The <i>third</i> thing I want to say to you
is, that <i>no</i> <span class="smcap2">OTHER</span> <i>Refuge will do but</i> <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>.</p>

<p>I would like you to take as your motto
the simple and beautiful words which a
Sabbath scholar, I knew well about,
lately gone to glory, wrote to his minister.
&ldquo;I am sure I may be very thankful
to God for His great mercy toward
me.... <i>I must just keep in mind that
there is one Refuge to flee to, and that is
Jesus.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are many other refuges people
try to take shelter in. They think they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">Pg 77</a></span>
will be as safe in them as in the <span class="smcap2">ONE</span> of
God's providing; but these will never
stand in that day which will try every
refuge of what sort it is.</p>

<p>I have seen some making their <i>own
goodness</i> their refuge-city. They imagined
they were not so bad as others.
They trusted in the falling Siloam-tower
of their own righteousness!</p>

<p>I have seen some making <i>God's goodness</i>
their refuge-city. They said to
themselves, &ldquo;God is kind. He surely
will not deal hardly with sinners at last.
Justice, the avenger, will not surely
always pursue with her flaming sword.
The love of God will surely get the better
of his justice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Don't let Satan deceive you. There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">Pg 78</a></span>
are many of <i>his</i> refuges which <i>appear</i> to
be safe enough, but on which God has
written &ldquo;<i>Refuges of lies</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were many other towns in Canaan
of old which <i>appeared</i> to be as
good and as safe as those I have been
speaking of. But no city could afford
shelter to the manslayer, excepting one
of the six God had specially appointed.</p>

<p>What would have happened if the
fugitive of old, in fleeing from the
avenger, had said to himself, &ldquo;What is
the use of my going so far away as to
Hebron or Golan? I would rather flee
to a nearer place. I will go to Jericho,
the old city of palm-trees; or to Bethlehem,
in the hills of Judah; or, better
still, I will go to Jerusalem, the capital<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">Pg 79</a></span>
of the nation, where the temple of Zion
is, and the palace of the King. Surely
I shall be safer far within its lofty walls
and bulwarks than in one of these little
cities of the Levites. Is it not said that
'<i>God is known in all her Palaces for a
Refuge</i>?'&rdquo;</p>

<p>If he had done so, he would undoubtedly
have perished. Neither King nor
Priest, nor Golden gate nor Beautiful
gate, nor wall nor bulwark, could have
saved him from the avenger's sword.
The refuge-towns appointed in the olden
time may have been &ldquo;the least amid the
cities of Judah.&rdquo; But they were God's
selection, God's ordering, and that was
enough. In them, and in them only,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">Pg 80</a></span>
was the manslayer safe from the avenger
of blood.</p>

<p>And so it is with our Gospel Refuge.
&ldquo;<i>Neither is there salvation in any other.</i>&rdquo;
Rejecting Jesus, we are lost for ever.
All other refuges, however good or great
or strong they may <i>appear</i> to be, will
prove only Babel-towers, that will fall on
the poor builders, and crush them in
their ruins.</p>

<p>When God told the children of Israel
to sprinkle their lintels and door-posts
with blood, they might have been foolish
enough to say, &ldquo;No; we shall do
better. We shall not be content with
doing so trifling a thing; we shall rather
build up great walls around our houses,
so that the destroying angel may not get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">Pg 81</a></span>
in.&rdquo; Do you think, if they had done
so, their first-born would have been
saved? No; there would have been
death in every such household; these
high walls would have proved useless.
Nothing but the red mark on the doorway
of the dwelling would be of any
avail in warding off the fell stroke.</p>

<p>So it is with the sinner. All the walls
which pride, and self-righteousness, and
good works can rear, will do nothing to
keep out the sword of avenging Justice.
But <i>the sprinkled blood of covenant mercy
will</i>; for &ldquo;<i>the blood of Jesus Christ,
God's Son, cleanseth</i> (and alone cleanseth)
<i>from</i> <span class="smcap2">ALL SIN</span>!&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>I remember, many years ago, attending<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">Pg 82</a></span>
the deathbed of a young man in
E&mdash;&mdash;. He told me, one day, he had
dreamt of being in a shop in &mdash;&mdash; Street,
which seemed to be hung round with
armour and coats of mail. A number
of people in the shop were girding these
on; while a man was standing with a
drawn sword in his hand outside the
door, ready to slay them as they passed
into the open street. One after another
he cut down;&mdash;the armour was no protection
to them&mdash;their bodies were lying
dead and wounded on the pavement.
In great fear and terror, the young man
said, his turn seemed at last to come,
when he, too, must try to cover himself
with the same armour, and rush out by
the fatal door. He knew not what to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">Pg 83</a></span>
do. In looking around him, he observed,
in the uppermost shelf, something resembling
a web of coarse linen, lying apparently
neglected. He resolved to take
it down, and wrap himself in a portion
of it, instead of the unavailing sheaths
of iron and steal. Covering his head
and body, he darted out, following the
footsteps of the others. The sword
descended; but it bounded back again.
It was unable to pierce the linen covering.
He alone was safe in that crowd
of dead and dying.</p>

<p>Beautifully did this youthful dreamer
apply his own &ldquo;vision of the night.&rdquo;
It was:&mdash;How vain are all the boasted
sheathings of the armour of self-righteousness;
and how safe and glorious is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">Pg 84</a></span>
that &ldquo;white linen&rdquo; covering of the righteousness
of Jesus! To the eye of reason,
the panoply of iron and steel seems the
best, and strongest, and securest. Many
will not &ldquo;submit themselves to the righteousness
of God,&rdquo; and persist in using
the others. But they will be a poor
protection against the sword of God's
avenging justice. Happy are those who
have been led to look <i>above</i> for another
righteousness, and who have listened to
the Divine injunction, &ldquo;<i>Put ye on the
Lord Jesus Christ!</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>Reader, let me ask, is this your case?
Don't think, because you are young, and
have committed few sins, that you are
safer than those who have committed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">Pg 85</a></span>
many, and that you have not the same
urgent need to flee to Jesus for refuge.
In Canaan of old, the manslayer was in
danger of his life, whether he had killed
one or several. One single life, like one
single sin, exposed him to the fury of
the avenger.</p>

<p>Nay, more. The Hebrew fugitive
<i>might elude</i> his avenger! He might
manage, for days, or weeks, or years,
to screen himself from his wrath. He
might go, as David did to avoid Saul,
to some cave of Adullam; he might
hide in the gloomy recesses of some
forest;&mdash;amid the oaks of Bashan, or
the rocky gorges of the Jordan, or
amid the cedar-heights of Lebanon;&mdash;in
the words of Ezekiel, &ldquo;dwelling safely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">Pg 86</a></span>
in the wilderness, and sleeping in the
woods.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> But it is different with the
sinner and <i>his</i> Avenger:&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Vengeance
is mine; and I</i> <span class="smcap2">WILL</span> <i>repay, saith the
Lord.</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Who can escape <i>His</i> glance?
Who can hide from <i>His</i> all-seeing eye?</p>

<p>The <i>fourth</i> thing I want to say to
you is:&mdash;That <i>many young and old</i>
<span class="smcap2">HAVE</span> <i>fled to Jesus, the Gospel City of
Refuge, and have found themselves safe
and happy there</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">Pg 87</a></span></p>

<p>How delightful it is, year by year, to
trace the footsteps of those, whether
young or old, rich or poor, who have
repaired to that blessed shelter! I
shall close this little volume by telling
you of <i>two</i> such, now inhabitants of the
better <i>celestial City</i>. Very different they
were in years, in country, in outward
position. But they were alike in this,&mdash;that
they fled in life to the gates of the
Gospel Refuge; and to both <i>the</i> <span class="smcap2">NAME</span> <i>of</i>
<span class="smcap">Jesus</span> was specially precious.</p>

<p>The one was C&mdash;&mdash; T&mdash;&mdash;, a little
girl thirteen years old&mdash;the age, I daresay,
of some whose eyes are falling on
these pages. I saw her when she was
bright and happy in her adopted home
in England&mdash;a sweet spot in the county<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">Pg 88</a></span>
of Kent, on one of those wooded heights
or uplands which command an extensive
prospect of the Thames, as he winds
along, hearing on his lordly bosom the
commerce of the world. Little did any
then dream, that that little life, so full of
promise, was to be early taken&mdash;her sun
going down before it was &ldquo;yet day!&rdquo;
So, however, the will of God was; her
summons came suddenly, unexpectedly.
Her disconsolate parents saw &ldquo;the desire
of their eyes taken away by a stroke.&rdquo;
The dear child herself was naturally of
a timid, reserved disposition; she felt
more than she said. Her kind, unselfish
heart delighted in devising plans of usefulness
and carrying them out. The
entire of her pocket-money was latterly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">Pg 89</a></span>
spent in the purchase of little books for
the infant-school children&mdash;all of whom
loved her much&mdash;or in publications for
loan among the elder Sunday class. She
won the affections of old as well as young.
&ldquo;The little lady who used to speak so
prettily to us,&rdquo; was the description given,
with full eyes, by more than one of the
villagers who had known her loving
ways, and heard her loving voice. In
another neighbourhood still more familiar
to her, she used to go to the cottages
with her Bible, and offer to read to the
inmates who most needed it; always
putting her little hands together first, to
ask for God's blessing, and then making
some simple remarks she thought might
be of use. Those whose hearts most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">Pg 90</a></span>
sorely mourned her, had the fullest assurance
that the grace of God had been
early poured into their dear child's heart.
But on thinking, too, on the past, they
began at times to wonder whether these
pleasing traits of character and efforts
to do good, were really prompted by
love to Jesus, or whether they might be
rather the effect of habit and the imitation
of others. They anxiously searched
among her little books and desk-treasures
to see if they could find anything to confirm
their fondest thoughts regarding this.
I believe it was even made the subject
of earnest prayer to God, that some such
precious testimony might be found.
After all her other books had been examined
in vain, imagine what were the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">Pg 91</a></span>
feelings of delight and thankfulness,
when, as one day she who loved her best
was taking the cover off her Bible, the
two following letters dropped from it on
the ground:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p style="text-align: right;">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">B. Parsonage</span>, <i>August.</i><br />
</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dearest Papa and Mamma</span>,&mdash;I
am going to write this in case I should
go to that <i>happy</i> land where sorrow
is not known, suddenly; and that
you may have <i>no</i> fears about my soul.
I know my state, and that my <i>precious</i>
Saviour has called me, and I humbly
accept this <i>glorious</i> invitation as a poor
<span class="smcap2">WRETCHED</span> sinner. I <i>strive</i> not to expect
redemption by my own poor merits.
I have no comparative fear of death, but
as a passage from a wicked world to a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">Pg 92</a></span>happy, happy home. Though I am by
nature very wicked, it is all washed away
by my Saviour's blood. The Holy Spirit
has taught me what to pray for, and how
to pray. I hope all my dear friends will
forgive me if I have been angry when
they have spoken to me about my faults.
I should like, dearest parents, whatever
little money and things I have, to be
given to the Church Missionary Society
and the Bible Society. My dear Saviour
has forgiven me all my <span class="smcap2">INNUMERABLE</span> sins,
and so, dear parents, you need not fear
about my soul. I believe my Saviour
will <i>not</i> forsake me if I trust in Him,
and I know that all my righteousness
is as filthy rags.&mdash;I remain, dearest parents,&rdquo;
&amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.,</p>

<p style="text-align: right;">&ldquo;C. M. T.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">Pg 93</a></span>The other paper that was found, was
probably intended for her brothers and
sisters. It is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;When you are in trouble, go to God
and tell Him all about it. The Saviour
who called little children to come to Him
will listen to you, no matter what the
subjects be, if you be but in earnest and
need His help. If you have a difficult
lesson to learn, a hasty spirit to subdue,
an unkind word to bear, a proud spirit
to humble&mdash;whatever your difficulty, take
it to God in the name of Jesus, and He
<i>will</i> help you. If even we, who see so
little beneath the surface, are not pleased
with outward appearances without good
qualities within, how much less is the
great God who searches the inmost re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">Pg 94</a></span>cesses
of the heart? 'The Lord seeth
not as man seeth; for man looketh on
the outward appearance, but the Lord
looketh on the heart.' What we require
is a new heart cleansed by the Holy
Spirit, full of all the graces mentioned in
St. Paul's Epistle to the Galatians, (chap.
v. 22.) Oh! go then to <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> and ask
of Him in earnest prayer to pardon your
sins, and to confer upon you the blessed
gift of a new heart.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>My young friends, have <i>you</i> fled like
C&mdash;&mdash; T&mdash;&mdash; to an all-gracious Saviour?
Is the &ldquo;<i>name</i> of Jesus,&rdquo; so sweet to <i>her</i>,
equally precious to you? Does it &ldquo;soothe
your sorrows,&rdquo; &ldquo;heal your wounds,&rdquo; and
drive your tears and fears all away?
Can you say, in the spirit of her beautiful
and comforting letter,&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">Pg 95</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Till then I shall His love proclaim<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With every fleeting breath;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And may the music of His <i>NAME</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Refresh my soul in death.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Having told you of one recently &ldquo;fallen
asleep in Jesus,&rdquo; who had early repaired
to the shelter of the Gospel Refuge,
I shall now tell you of an aged
servant of Jesus who has, more recently
still, entered on her glorious rest.</p>

<p>She was a former parishioner of mine.
Her home was a lowly cottage in one of
the loveliest villages of Scotland. Poor
in this world, and an almost constant
sufferer, she was rich in faith,&mdash;one of
&ldquo;Christ's jewels;&rdquo;&mdash;her life was &ldquo;hid
with Christ in God.&rdquo; If I could venture
to name two peculiarities in her spiritual
being which distinguished her more than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">Pg 96</a></span>
others, it would be these: Love for <i>the</i>
<span class="smcap2">NAME</span> <i>of</i> <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>, and a <i>Life of</i> <span class="smcap2">PRAYER</span>.
&ldquo;His <i>name</i>,&rdquo; to her, was &ldquo;like ointment
poured forth.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Often have I delighted
to sit with her in her cottage, with her
Bible on her knee, and hear her speak
of &ldquo;the <i>name</i> which is above every
name;&rdquo; walking about these six Refuge-Cities,
&ldquo;telling all the towers, marking
the bulwarks, and considering the palaces.&rdquo;
She had herself long before, in
early life, fled to the Gospel stronghold.
I think her favourite city would have
been <span class="smcap">Golan</span>, &ldquo;Joy.&rdquo; Her heart seemed
ever to be filled with &ldquo;peace and <i>joy</i>
in believing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Doubtless much of this calm serenity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">Pg 97</a></span>
and joy she derived from her life of
<i>prayer</i>. It is no small matter for the
writer of these pages to know, that there
was not a day for upwards of sixteen
years in which he was not personally
and specially remembered by this lowly
saint at a throne of grace.</p>

<p>One forenoon during this past year,
she had entered her cottage, carrying a
pitcher of water down from the well in
her garden. It was the last time she
crossed her threshold. When her door
was opened, she was <i>found alone on her
knees;</i> <span class="smcap2">BUT</span> <i>her spirit had fled!</i> <span class="smcap">Prayer</span>,
as it had been her ever fond delight in
life, had been her solace and comfort in
death. Her last act was drawing water
out of the better &ldquo;<i>wells of salvation</i>.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">Pg 98</a></span>
She began with <i>prayer</i>, but ended in
<i>praise</i>! She began her prayer on earth,
and &ldquo;finished it with the angels!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reader! when you come to die, could
<i>you</i> be equally happy, equally safe?
Would you be able thus to rejoice and
triumph in the <i>name of Jesus</i>? Could
you declare, with either of these two
glorified spirits, before God &ldquo;took&rdquo;
them, &ldquo;<i>We</i> <span class="smcap2">HAVE</span> <i>a strong city; salvation
hath God appointed for walls and for
bulwarks</i>?&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Has the Holy Spirit taught
you, as it taught them, that you are
sinners by nature, and in a state of condemnation?
Have you heard God's
voice behind you, declaring that &ldquo;He
can by no means clear the guilty?&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">Pg 99</a></span>
And are you able now joyfully to say,
&ldquo;I heard Thy voice, and I was afraid, because
I was naked, and <i>I hid myself</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Are you, like them, really &ldquo;hid&rdquo;
<i>within</i> the gates? The manslayer of
old required to be <i>within</i> the refuge-city.
Even if he were but one footstep without,
the avenger of blood could cut him
down. It did not matter <i>how</i> near he
was, if he was not <i>inside</i> the portals!</p>

<p>And so it will avail you nothing to
know about Christ, and hear about
Christ;&mdash;to survey the strength of the
city's walls, the glory of its battlements,
and the beauty of its palaces. It is
&ldquo;<i>the righteous who</i> <span class="smcap2">RUNNETH</span> <i>into it</i>,&rdquo; who
alone is &ldquo;<i>safe</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What more, in closing, have I to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">Pg 100</a></span>
say, but to repeat the solemn word,
&ldquo;<i>Haste thee, flee for thy life!</i>&rdquo; Every
hour you put off, the time is shorter;
the avenger is nearer; the chances of
escape are fewer. There is no time for
delay. I say this to the very youngest.
I say more. As young feet can run
fastest, so it is with young souls. You
will never go to Jesus so easily as now.
Let nothing keep you back. It is said
that on digging up the ruins of Herculaneum,
(the city that was buried under
the lava of Mount Vesuvius,) the body
of a man was found in an upright posture,
in the act of running out of the
door of his house to escape destruction.
He had a bag of gold in his hand.
Others had escaped in safety. But this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">Pg 101</a></span>
miser loved his gold more than his life.
He had returned to fetch it, thinking he
would have time enough to escape the
terrible doom; but the burning stream
overtook him. He was encased in a
living sepulchre.</p>

<p>It was one, too, of the saddest incidents
connected with these Cities of
Refuge of old, when some poor, breathless,
panting fugitive&mdash;just when he
was in sight of the city&mdash;when he had
almost reached the gate, sank exhausted.
Or perhaps the case of some other who
had lain down weary to sleep, but who
had been startled by the avenger at his
side, and the drawn sword gleaming
before his eyes;&mdash;years after, the pile<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">Pg 102</a></span>
of stones marking the spot where his
blood had been shed.</p>

<p>But, oh, sadder, sadder far, for any,
young or old, to perish within sight of
Christ! To suffer the love of sin, or
the love of pleasure, or the love of the
world, to make them &ldquo;too late!&rdquo; To
be <i>almost</i>, but not <i>altogether</i> saved!
To be cut down by the sword of wrath,
or overtaken by the fiery stream, with
heaven in view!</p>

<p>God grant that this may not be the
case with any one of <i>you</i>!</p>

<p>I shall conclude with a happier picture:&mdash;The
citizens in these Refuge-cities
of old, were sometimes seen clustered on
the top of the walls, watching the approach
of the manslayer, and cheering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">Pg 103</a></span>
him on when faint and exhausted. So,
think of the happy citizens of the New
Jerusalem: Patriarchs, prophets, saints,
departed friends, who are now safe
within its gates, watching you from
these glorious heights, beckoning to
you not to tarry, but to be &ldquo;followers
of them who, through faith and patience,
are inheriting the promises.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Verily I say unto you, There is joy
in heaven among the angels of God
over every sinner that repenteth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We have been speaking of the &ldquo;<i>name</i>
of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Read the motto over the gateway of
all these six cities. Read the motto
over the door of the Gospel Refuge:&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Neither
is there salvation in any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">Pg 104</a></span> other: for there is none other</i> <span class="smcap">name</span>
given under heaven among men by
which the sinner can be saved, but <i>the</i>
<span class="smcap2">NAME</span> of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>The Rock of Castello.</h2>


<p>As I was walking on a bright summer
evening, among the Italian Alps, I came
to one of the lovely valleys of the Waldenses.
These, perhaps I should tell
my young readers, are a pious race of
Christians, who have, age after age,
boldly &ldquo;contended for the faith once
delivered to the saints,&rdquo; and kept the
lamp of truth brightly burning, when all
around was darkness.</p>

<p>This beautiful spot is surrounded by
very lofty mountains, whose tops are
almost lost in the clouds, while the little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">Pg 110</a></span>
stream that murmurs below has its banks
covered with vines and mulberry trees,
rich corn fields, and happy villages.
When I first entered it by the Alpine
pass of La Croix, the whole valley was
shrouded in a dense fog, with the exception
of one bold and very remarkable
Rock, which towered in solitary grandeur
above the sea of mist, and seemed from
its height like an island suspended in
mid-air!</p>

<p>Upon inquiring what this Rock was,
I was informed it is a place famous in
the history of the Valley. When the
poor peasants were persecuted by their
foes, their cottages and hamlets plundered,
their loved sanctuaries burnt with
fire, and &ldquo;all their pleasant things laid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">Pg 111</a></span>
waste,&rdquo; they would retire with their
wives and little ones up to this rocky
citadel, which the God of nature seemed
to have reared as a shelter for His defenceless
people.</p>

<p>Within this Rock that same God had
wonderfully provided for their safety
and comfort. It contains a large cavern,
capable of holding many at a time; and
in the very centre of this cave is a fountain
of water, which yields a never-failing
supply. When driven thither by
the storms of persecution, the exiles provided
themselves with food, from the
plentiful wild fruits of the adjoining
mountain, so that the Bible promise was
made good to them, &ldquo;Their bread shall
be given them, and their water shall be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">Pg 112</a></span>
sure!&rdquo; Swords and cannon and other
means of defense they had none, but a
single man, stationed at the mouth of the
cave, was enough to defy hundreds of
armed soldiers. He had only to hurl
fragments of loose stones (which were
supplied from the sides of the cavern)
down upon the foe, and they were instantly
beaten back, thus fulfilling God's
words to Israel, &ldquo;Five of you shall chase
an hundred, and an hundred of you shall
put ten thousand to flight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Often, often, then, when the wintry
tempests and Alpine storms, and drifting
snows, were raging fiercely around,
adding to the terrors of the enemy, did
these peasant warriors find in the Rock
of Castello a secure shelter and retreat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">Pg 113</a></span>
With their fountain and blazing fire,
their Bibles and their God, they would
make the rocky cavern ring with praise.
They &ldquo;feared the Lord,&rdquo; and had no
other fear. He had &ldquo;given his angels
charge over them;&rdquo; and they could
boldly make the challenge, &ldquo;God is for
us, who can be against us?&rdquo;</p>

<br />

<p>When I heard about this Rock, which
the &ldquo;God of <i>Nature</i>&rdquo; had upreared as a
citadel for his oppressed people, it reminded
me of a better <span class="smcap">Rock</span>, which
&ldquo;the God of <i>Grace</i>&rdquo; has provided for
perishing sinners!</p>

<p>Dear Children!&mdash;You are all, by nature,
like these poor Christians of the
Alps, the inhabitants of a Valley. It is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">Pg 114</a></span>
called &ldquo;<i>The Valley of Tears</i>!&rdquo; Like
theirs, too, it is a lovely valley, far too
lovely for sinful man; but though lovely,
its name tells you it is a <i>Valley of Weeping</i>.
Sin has made it so. And more
than this, it is a <i>Valley of Danger</i>, a
<i>Valley of Death</i>!</p>

<p>It is full of <i>Enemies</i>. I can not tell
you them all, &ldquo;their name is Legion,
for they are many.&rdquo; There are:</p>

</table></div>

<p>Methinks I hear my young readers exclaiming,
If my enemies are so many, if
my danger is so great, is there no place
I can flee to? &ldquo;What must I do to be
saved&rdquo; from those enemies in this <i>Valley<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">Pg 116</a></span> of Tears</i>? Oh! whither shall I flee from
the &ldquo;wrath to come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hear the voice of God:&mdash;He is pointing
to a Rock rising from the midst of
the Valley, and is calling aloud to you,
&ldquo;Flee to this Stronghold, ye prisoners of
Hope!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Do you ask&mdash;When shall I flee? He
answers, &ldquo;<i>Now</i> is the day of salvation!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Do you ask&mdash;May I not <i>wait</i> a few
years? I am yet a young inhabitant of
the Valley. Death, if he be the <i>surest</i>
enemy, is the <i>last</i> enemy; have I not yet
time enough? God answers&mdash;<span class="smcap">To-day</span>!
while it is called to-day! &ldquo;Verily, there
may be but a step between thee and
Death!&rdquo; &ldquo;Haste thee; flee for thy
life.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">Pg 117</a></span></p>

<p>Do you ask&mdash;But must I leave all the
pleasures of sin, and so much that I love
in this valley of tears? God answers,
&ldquo;What is a man profited, if he should
gain the whole world, and lose his own
soul?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Do you ask&mdash;But is there no <i>other</i>
refuge than this, no other means of safety
but, amid storm and tempest, to climb to
this Rock? God answers, &ldquo;Neither is
there salvation in any other! For there
is none other name given under heaven,
by which a sinner can be saved, but the
name of Jesus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dear children, let this be <i>your</i> prayer:
&ldquo;Lord, lead me unto this <span class="smcap">Rock</span>, that is
higher than I!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oh! with what delight does that Great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">Pg 118</a></span>
God look upon children, such as you,
when they &ldquo;flee for refuge to lay hold
on this hope set before them;&rdquo; and
when they join their hearts and their
voices together, saying, &ldquo;Oh! come, let
us sing unto the Lord; let us make a
joyful noise unto the <span class="smcap">Rock of our salvation</span>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But I would like to tell my Young
Readers something more about this
Great &ldquo;Refuge from the storm&rdquo;&mdash;this
Great &ldquo;Covert from the tempest.&rdquo; Let
us seat ourselves for a little in the Alpine
valley, under the brow of the Rock of
Castello; it may help us to some thoughts
of the better &ldquo;Rock of Ages!&rdquo; I dare
say many a poor Waldensian, when taking
shelter in this earthly refuge, would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">Pg 119</a></span>
be often reminded by it of the <span class="smcap">Rock</span>
that can never be shaken!</p>

<p><i>First</i>, The Rock of Castello <i>is very
High</i>. So is <i>Jesus</i>; so High, that He
is called <i>the Son of the Highest</i>&mdash;&ldquo;The
Ancient of Days!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;God over all.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The heaven of heavens can not contain
Him!&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Second</i>, The Rock of Castello <i>rises
from the Valley</i>: so Jesus rose from
poor parents in this valley of tears. He
&ldquo;humbled Himself,&rdquo; to take upon Him
our nature; so that &ldquo;although he be
<span class="smcap2">HIGH</span>, He might have respect unto the
<i>lowly</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Third</i>, The Rock of Castello <i>was quite
close at hand</i>; though lofty, it was
always near for fleeing to: so is Jesus,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">Pg 120</a></span>
the &ldquo;Rock of Ages.&rdquo; We have not to
say, &ldquo;Who shall ascend into Heaven to
bring Christ down?&rdquo; &ldquo;He is not far
from any one of us.&rdquo; Indeed, He is so
very near, and so very accessible, that
the only wonder is that there should be
any found who do not &ldquo;flee to Him for
refuge!&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Fourth</i>, The Rock of Castello <i>was
wont to shelter many children and helpless
infants</i>; many poor mothers, driven
from their homes, carried their babes
thither in their arms. Jesus, the living
Rock, does the same. He delighted,
when on earth, to fold children to his
bosom, and say, &ldquo;Suffer little children
to come unto me, and forbid them not!&rdquo;
It was neither His nor His &ldquo;Father's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">Pg 121</a></span>
will&rdquo; that so much as &ldquo;one of these
little ones should perish.&rdquo; He was so
<span class="smcap2">HIGH</span> that angels adored Him; so meek
and lowly, that infants smiled in his
arms!</p>

<p><i>Fifth</i>, The Rock of Castello <i>has a
large cleft or opening in it, which admits
into the cavern</i>. Jesus is a <i>rent</i> and
<i>smitten</i> Rock! You can enter by faith
<i>into</i> Him only through His opened side.
Oh! what a smiting that was, by the
rod of God's justice! and yet, had there
been no such smiting, you and I, Dear
Children, must have <i>perished</i>!</p>

<p><i>Sixth</i>, The Rock of Castello <i>was a
Secure Hiding Place</i>. No other spot in
all the valley could have afforded shelter
but this. On any of the surrounding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">Pg 122</a></span>
mountains there would have been
certain destruction to the exiles, from
the Alpine snows, and fierce hurricanes
and storms. But here, in their cavern,
nothing could touch them, and if the
storm raged, it spent its fury on the
Rock!</p>

<p>Jesus is, indeed, a <i>safe Shelter</i>, while
every other refuge will prove &ldquo;a refuge
of lies!&rdquo; The tempest of God's wrath,
and the curses of God's law, are still
raging fiercely all around. But what
matters it? They can not touch <i>You</i>,
my Young Friends, <i>if sheltered in the
Rock!</i> Upon that <span class="smcap">Rock</span>, eighteen hundred
years ago, they exhausted all their
fury. Jesus shelters and delivers you
from that fearful storm of Law-curses,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">Pg 123</a></span> by
himself being &ldquo;made a curse for
you!&rdquo; The tempest may smite <i>Jesus
the Rock</i>, but it can not touch those who
have &ldquo;won Him, and are <span class="smcap2">FOUND IN</span><span class="smcap">Him</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Seventh</i>, The Rock of Castello <i>has a
Fountain in it</i>. Jesus, the Living Rock,
has opened a Fountain not only &ldquo;for
Sin,&rdquo; but &ldquo;for Uncleanness.&rdquo; He does
not wish only to <i>justify</i> you, by sheltering
you from the Storms of the Law,&mdash;but
He wishes also to <i>sanctify</i> you, and
fit you for glory. He does not only
wish to make you <i>Safe</i>, but to make you
<i>Holy</i>. The <span class="smcap">Holy Spirit</span> is this <i>Fountain</i>
in the Rock. Oh! Dear Children,
bless God for this &ldquo;Well of Water,
springing up unto everlasting life.&rdquo; It
washes, and cleanses, and refreshes you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">Pg 124</a></span>
Without it, your naturally <i>unholy</i> hearts
could never be fitted for the holy, happy
heaven, of a Holy, Happy God.</p>

<p><i>Eighth</i>, The Rock of Castello <i>remains
as it was to this hour</i>, while all its brave
inmates of past generations are no more.
Jesus is an <i>Everlasting</i> Rock, unchanged
and unchangeable. This is still &ldquo;His
name, and still His memorial,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jesus
Christ, the same yesterday, to-day, and
for ever!&rdquo; For six thousand years, sinners
have been crowding in, and &ldquo;still
there is room!&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Ninth</i>, The Rock of Castello <i>was only
a safe retreat so long as those who fled
for refuge remained within its cave</i>.
The enemy were continually on the
watch, and to venture out, would be to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">Pg 125</a></span>
<i>perish</i>! Jesus, the &ldquo;Rock of Ages,&rdquo;
thus speaks to you, &ldquo;Abide in me!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Out of me, ye can do nothing.&rdquo; It is
only &ldquo;the Righteous who runneth <i>into</i>
Him that is <i>safe</i>! To <i>abide</i> in Jesus is
to be secure from every danger, to <i>leave</i>
Him is <i>destruction</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Tenth</i>, The Rock of Castello <i>had to
be fled to in the first moment of danger</i>.
The only safety of the persecuted
was in <i>instant flight</i>. On the first tidings
of the enemy, houses, and lands,
and vineyards, and all they possessed,
had to be left, and, &ldquo;forgetting the
the things that were behind, they pressed
forward&rdquo; to their Rock! Jesus tells
<i>you</i>, dear children, your only safety
consists in <i>immediate</i> flight to Himself,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">Pg 126</a></span>
the Rock of Ages! Delay may be fatal!
The storm-blast is gathering, the sky
is darkening, there is the distant muttering
of the thunder. The enemy is
on the march&mdash;Satan is watching&mdash;Death
is approaching. Already he may
have strung his arrow. &ldquo;Flee to the
stronghold, ye prisoners of Hope,&mdash;</p>

<center>
TO-DAY.&rdquo;<br />
</center>

<p>Oh! forbid that this should be <i>your</i>
history now, and your history through
eternity (How awful are the words!)&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They lightly esteemed the <i>Rock of
their Salvation</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<br />

<p>Reader!&mdash;Have <i>you</i> fled to this Living
&ldquo;Rock of Ages?&rdquo;&mdash;Have you made
it your prayer,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">Pg 127</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Jesus! Refuge of my Soul!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me to Thy bosom fly?&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And in <i>that</i> bosom, and <i>that</i> refuge,
are you hiding yourself until all Earth's
&ldquo;calamities be overpast?&rdquo; The deeper
you hide yourself in the clefts of the
smitten Rock, the safer you are. Oh!
do you ever pause and think that there
is a day coming, when this Valley of
Tears &ldquo;and all the works that are
therein, shall be burned up?&rdquo; When
&ldquo;God shall arise in the glory of His
Majesty, to shake terribly the Earth.&rdquo;
When every mountain peak shall be
black with tempest&mdash;and the whole valley
shall be a sheet of living fire! Then
(as I saw on the evening I entered
this Alpine valley), there shall be but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">Pg 128</a></span>
<span class="smcap">One Rock</span> seen rising far above the
mist, and thunderings, and lightnings,
and tempest! JESUS CHRIST, the
Rock of Ages! the Sinner's Refuge!
and the Sinner's Friend! Many voices
shall be heard beneath in the valley,
calling upon <i>other Rocks</i>, but it will be
to hide them from the &ldquo;<i>wrath of the
Lamb</i>!&rdquo; The loose fragments of stone
thrown down from the Rock of Castello
crushed hundreds: &ldquo;On whomsoever
<span class="smcap">This Stone</span> shall fall, it will <i>grind
them to powder</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oh, when the voice of the Great
Judge shall resound through the dens
and caves of the Earth with the Question,&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Sinner,
where are thou?</i>&rdquo;&mdash;How
blessed if you shall be able, from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">Pg 129</a></span>
your safe shelter, to reply, &ldquo;Here am
I, Lord! I heard Thy voice, and I
was afraid, because I was naked, and
I hid myself!&rdquo; Hid yourself! where?
Hid myself in</p>
